Apex is a strongly typed, object-oriented programming language that allows developers to execute flow and transaction control statements on the Salesforce Platform server, in conjunction with calls to the API.

- Case insenistive 
- Easy to test
- Multi tenant environment
- Supporter across different versions 
- No need to connect database separately

NOTE - Always use API Names for objects and fields ( Sometimes object's name and API name could be different)
