## 1. :heavy_exclamation_mark: **TODO** - If you update or delete a record in its before trigger, or delete a record in its after trigger, you will receive a runtime  error. This includes both direct and indirect operations. [:link:](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_triggers.htm#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20if%20you%20update%20or%20delete%20a,and%20you%20will%20receive%20a%20runtime%20error.)

---------------------

 ## 2. The records which initiates the database operation are read only in the after triggers. You can not modify field's value in after triggers if that record initiates the execution of trigger. [ðŸ”—](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_triggers.htm#:~:text=Before%20triggers%20are,are%20read%2Donly.)

--------------------

## 3. We can modify records by which trigger occurs in it's before events but not in after events. (No need of DML statements for this records as they implicitely saved in trigger flow). We can't modify other records (Other than records which fires the trigger) in before events using DML statements (Only way to update other records). But we can modify other records in after events. 

***Note** -This statement is specific to same event and same operation in trigger. DML statement is performed inside same event. Events and operation to be performed are same here, example - updating record in update event, deleteing record in delete event, inseting record in isert event*

***Simple rule don't use any DML statements in before triggers for updating/ inserting/ deleting records ( Records other than which causes trigger fired)[:link:](https://developer.salesforce.com/forums/?id=906F0000000AuaRIAS#:~:text=It%20means%20you%20can%20not%20do%20any%20dml%20like%20update%20or%20delete%20for%20the%20object%20on%20which%20you%20are%20writing%20trigger.%C2%A0)***

- Record names used here are - `Sanket number` format

### 3a. Update record in trigger -

#### :x: If you update other record in its before update trigger - it gives error. 

```java
trigger temp on Account (before update) {
    // assuming that single record initialize the trigger
    if(Trigger.isBefore){
        Account record = new Account();
        System.debug('Before Trigger - ');
        record = Trigger.new[0];
        System.debug('Record which causes trigger -');
        System.debug(record);
        List<Account> accLis = [select Name,ID from Account where Name ='Sanket' or Name ='Sanket 1'];
        System.debug('Existing records in database');
        
        for(Account temp: accLis){
            System.debug(temp);
            temp.Name+= 'Updated';
        }
        update accLis; // Direct DML Operation
    }   
}
```

#### :white_check_mark: If you update other record in its after update trigger - it's fine. No error

```java
trigger temp on Account (after update ) {
    // assuming that single record initialize the trigger
    if(Trigger.isAfter){
        Account record = new Account();
        System.debug('After Trigger - ');
        record = Trigger.new[0];
        System.debug('Record which causes trigger -');
        System.debug(record);

        for(Account temp: accLis){
            System.debug(temp);
            temp.Name+= 'Updated';
        }
        update accLis; // Direct DML Operation
    }   
}
```

### 3b .Insert record in trigger - 

#### :x: If you insert other record in its before insert trigger - it gives error. 

```java
trigger temp on Account (before insert ) {
    // assuming that single record initialize the trigger
    if(Trigger.isBefore){
        Account record = new Account();
        System.debug('Before Trigger - ');
        record = Trigger.new[0];
        System.debug('Record which causes trigger -');
        System.debug(record);
        //System.debug('Record is updated -');
        //record.Name+= ' Updated';
        //System.debug(record);
        Account a = new Account(Name = 'Sanket 2');
        List<Account> t = [ select Name,ID from Account where Name = 'Sanket 2'];
        System.debug('Is Sanket 2 present'+ t.size());
        if(t.size() == 0)
        	insert a;
    }   
}
```

### 3c. Delete record in trigger - 

#### :x: If you delete other record in its before delete trigger - it gives error.

        System.debug('Record which causes trigger - we can\'t access trigger.new context variable in delete event. But we can query for deleted records in Apex');
